### {timestamp} — {task summary}

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Agent routed** | {Name} ({Role}) |
| **Why chosen** | {Routing rationale — what in the request matched this agent} |
| **Mode** | {`background` / `sync`} |
| **Why this mode** | {Brief reason — e.g., "No hard data dependencies" or "User needs to approve architecture"} |
| **Files authorized to read** | {Exact file paths the agent was told to read} |
| **File(s) agent must produce** | {Exact file paths the agent is expected to create or modify} |
| **Outcome** | {Completed / Rejected by {Reviewer} / Escalated} |

---

## Rules

1. **One file per agent spawn.** Named `{timestamp}-{agent-name}.md`.
2. **Log BEFORE spawning.** The entry must exist before the agent runs.
3. **Update outcome AFTER the agent completes.** Fill in the Outcome field.
4. **Never delete or edit past entries.** Append-only.
5. **If a reviewer rejects work,** log the rejection as a new entry with the revision agent.

| Field | Value |

### 2026-05-03T23:24:56-07:00 — Hockney: CMake→Xcode iOS Viability Analysis

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Agent routed** | Hockney (Platform Engineer) |
| **Why chosen** | User Q&A: "CMake can call Xcode build, that should still work right?" — iOS platform/build system expertise required |
| **Mode** | sync |
| **Why this mode** | Factual investigation + decision (no implementation); user seeks quick answer |
| **Files authorized to read** | `vcpkg/buildtrees/raylib/src/5.5-*/src/platforms/`, `CMakeOptions.txt`, `vcpkg-overlay/raylib/portfile.cmake`, upstream PR #3880, raylib ROADMAP.md |
| **File(s) agent must produce** | Decision document in `.squad/decisions/inbox/hockney-cmake-xcode-ios-viability.md` |
| **Outcome** | ✅ Completed — **CMake→Xcode call works ✅; iOS runtime fails ❌.** Evidence: raylib 5.5 has no `rcore_ios.c`; upstream PR #3880 unmerged; vcpkg iOS workaround configures Desktop+GLFW (incompatible with iOS UIKit). Three options identified: A (adopt PR #3880, 6–8 weeks), B (SDL2 wrapper, 4 weeks), C (Emscripten WebView, 3 weeks). **Recommendation:** HOLD until raylib 6.0 or explicit team scope/timeline approval. User directive captured: willing to accept iOS implementation path. |

## 2026-05-03 23:35:53 — Scribe: Merge rcore_ios Clarification

**Session:** scribe-merge-rcore-ios  
**Trigger:** Scheduled task (Team ROOT: Scribe Manifest)  
**Components:**
1. Merge .squad/decisions/inbox/* into .squad/decisions.md
2. Clear processed inbox entries
3. Commit .squad files if staged

### Execution Log

| Step | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Identify inbox decision | ✅ Found `hockney-rcore-ios-source-clarification.md` |
| 2 | Read investigation result | ✅ Confirmed 1422 bytes, complete findings |
| 3 | Append to decisions.md | ✅ Merged under "2026-05-03 — Hockney: rcore_ios Source Clarification" |
| 4 | Remove inbox file | ✅ Deleted processed entry |
| 5 | Create session log | ✅ Written to `.squad/sessions/2026-05-03T23-35-53-scribe-merge-rcore-ios.md` |
| 6 | Update orchestration log | ✅ This entry |
| 7 | Stage & commit | 🔄 Pending |

### Key Findings Merged

**Source:** `hockney-rcore-ios-source-clarification.md`

**Verdict:** ✅ **CONFIRMED ABSENT** — No bug; this is intended architecture

**Evidence:**
- raylib 5.5 (commit `05442024c3fda64320bd25d2251cc9807b84fb6f`)
- Platform files: rcore_android, rcore_desktop_glfw, rcore_desktop_rgfw, rcore_desktop_sdl, rcore_drm, rcore_web, rcore_template
- **rcore_ios.c does not exist** (verified in vendored source and upstream master)
- iOS uses Desktop backend by design (vcpkg portfile.cmake line 60–61 forces `-DPLATFORM=Desktop`)

**Implication:** iOS is not first-class platform in raylib 5.5; falls back to Desktop. Custom implementation or raylib 6.0+ needed for native iOS support.

### Inbox Status

**Before:** 1 entry  
**Processed:** `hockney-rcore-ios-source-clarification.md`  
**After:** 0 entries (cleared)

### Files Modified

- `.squad/decisions.md` — Appended ~40 lines (new investigation section)
- `.squad/decisions/inbox/` — Removed 1 file
- `.squad/sessions/` — Added 1 file (session log)
- `.squad/orchestration-log.md` — This entry (will be committed)

### 2026-05-03T23:39:19-07:00 — Hockney: raylib Cheatsheet vs. iOS Platform Support Clarification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Agent routed** | Hockney (Platform Engineer) |
| **Why chosen** | User Q: "Does the raylib v4.2 cheatsheet prove iOS support?" — Platform tooling & API semantics require engineer expertise |
| **Mode** | sync |
| **Why this mode** | Quick clarification task; investigates documentation vs. source semantics; no implementation needed |
| **Files authorized to read** | raylib v4.2 cheatsheet (reference), `vcpkg/buildtrees/raylib/src/5.5-*/src/platforms/`, `.squad/decisions.md` (rcore_ios entry) |
| **File(s) agent must produce** | Decision document in `.squad/decisions/inbox/hockney-cheatsheet-ios-clarification.md` |
| **Outcome** | ✅ Completed — **Cheatsheet does NOT prove iOS support.** Key finding: Cheatsheet documents public API surface (version-agnostic), NOT platform backends (version-specific). A function in the cheatsheet ≠ platform implementation. raylib 5.5 CMake enum confirms: `Desktop;Web;Android;Raspberry Pi;DRM;SDL` — iOS absent. ROADMAP lists iOS as planned [ ]. Unmerged PR #3880 provides actual `rcore_ios.c`. **Outcome:** Clarification merged into decisions.md; cheatsheet-specific response template documented for future user questions. |
